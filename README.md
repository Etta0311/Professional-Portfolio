# Homework 02 Portfolio

## Description

In this task, I am required to build up a my personal portfolio from scratch.
HTML and CSS helps me on building the basic elements needed for the website, and I added Javascript properties to my gallery as extras.
Thoughout the whole project, I was stucked at first on getting confuse about how the flexbox and div works,
this takes me for a few days to figure it out.
Been worried if i cannot finish this task on time and probably not able to master coming topics that is more difficult but yet,
I had a huge sense of accomplishment after it was done.

2. Group sections into same class selector

   For sections and asides that share the same properties on displays or text style
   As to make it simplier in css file and easier to search, using the same class can easily applied everything by once.

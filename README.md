## Description
HTML and CSS helps me on building the basic elements needed for the website, and I added Javascript properties to my gallery as extras.
Thoughout the whole project, I was stucked at first on getting confuse about how the flexbox and div works,
this takes me for a few days to figure it out.
Been worried if i cannot finish this task on time and probably not able to master coming topics that is more difficult but yet,
I had a huge sense of accomplishment after it was done.
